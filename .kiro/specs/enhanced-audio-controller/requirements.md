# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing audio generation controller to provide better error handling, validation, logging, and response management. The enhanced controller will improve reliability, maintainability, and user experience when generating audio files through the TTS service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling in the audio generation controller, so that I can better debug issues and provide meaningful error messages to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid request is received THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response with specific error codes
2. WHEN the TTS service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating service unavailability
3. WHEN Google Cloud API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information while returning user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the full error stack trace for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent and structured API responses, so that I can reliably handle success and error cases in the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio generation succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a standardized success response with audio URL and metadata
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured validation error messages
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent error response format
4. IF multiple validation errors exist THEN the system SHALL return all validation errors in a single response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of audio generation requests, so that I can monitor system usage and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio generation request is received THEN the system SHALL log request details including text length and voice settings
2. WHEN audio generation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL log success details including file size and generation time
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with correlation IDs for tracking
4. WHEN voice settings are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and log the applied voice configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust input validation for audio generation requests, so that I receive clear feedback when my input is invalid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is empty or missing THEN the system SHALL return a validation error with specific guidance
2. WHEN text exceeds maximum length limits THEN the system SHALL return a length validation error
3. WHEN invalid voice settings are provided THEN the system SHALL return voice configuration validation errors
4. WHEN required voice parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL apply sensible defaults and log the applied defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the controller to handle concurrent requests efficiently, so that multiple users can generate audio simultaneously without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple audio generation requests are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently without blocking
2. WHEN the system is under high load THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting
3. WHEN file naming conflicts might occur THEN the system SHALL ensure unique filename generation
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup of temporary resources
